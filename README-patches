This repository collects the source code of NetHack 3.6.0
(http://www.nethack.org/) with all published patches and other known bugs fixed
as described in bugfixes.txt.

The master branch contains only bug fixes. The interfaces branch, when
complete, will feature Unicode support on the map and additional user
interfaces:

* SDL 2
* Qt 4 or 5
* A Unicode-enabled Curses interface

The above listed interfaces will all support Unicode on the map. Unicode will
also be available for TTY on Unix (including Linux and Mac OS X) and for TTY
and Win32 on the Windows NT series (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 8 and 10).

Qt 3 may eventually support Unicode if I feel like including it. X11 could
support Unicode, but the Athena label widget is broken and the Xorg developers
have made it clear that they have no intention of fixing it. Thus Unicode
cannot be supported on X11.
